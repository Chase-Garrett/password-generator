## Usage
In order to use the password generator simply click the button labeled "Generate Password". After clicking the button the user will be given a set of prompts. 

The first prompt the user will have to enter the length they want the password to be, this generator allows for passwords to be between 8 and 128 characters.

The remaining prompts allow the user to select either "OK" for yes or "Cancel" for no. These prompts ask the user what kind of characters they want in their password. The options are:

* lowercase letters
* uppercase letters
* numbers
* special characters

**NOTE: Making a selection for a type of character does not guarantee that any characters of that type will make it into the password, it only means that they *may* show up in the generated password.**
